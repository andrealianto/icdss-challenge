_October 2018_

## Overview
Companies are increasingly worried about if and when their customers will pay their bills. Our objective is to predict with accuracy if a customer will pay their bill on time.

## Dataset
The data contains information about the payment behaviour of a company's customers. This can be found in the `dataset.csv` file with the appropriate labels in the first row. It can be used to predict whether a customer will pay their bill on time, and which customers are likely to pay faster. This is crucial to most companies as they need to optimise their collection efforts.
